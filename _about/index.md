The City of Austin is using open data to increase transparency, efficiency, and opportunities for collaboration. We encourage the use of public data that the City of Austin has published to spark innovation, promote public collaboration, increase government transparency, and inform decision making.

*"The City of Austin is committed to an open and transparent government. I believe this is an integral part of maintaining a vital and robust democracy."*

   -- Marc Ott, Austin City Manager, April 2015

## History
In December 2011, Austin’s City Council voted to officially support the adoption of an open government framework. In 2013, the City Manager delivered a four-point plan for making City operations more open. This plan, known as the Open Government Directive, identifies multiple performance expectations related to open data.
