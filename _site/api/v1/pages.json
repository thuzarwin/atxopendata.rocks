There are lots of [civil servants in the federal government who want to do things differently](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/12/12/renata-maziarz-model-civil-servant/). But often in government, doing things differently is equated with *risk*, and *risk* is something to be minimized as much as possible. So, it can be hard to figure out how to get started and how to bring your fellow civil servants on the journey with you in your quest for better outcomes. The problem is, there’s some serious confirmation bias at work here. Just because we’ve always done things one way, does not mean that doing them differently is more risky, but humans do have a tendency to see it that way. For all we know, the way we’re doing things now *is* high risk, but we just don’t acknowledge it. If you’re looking to change the way your team designs and develops software projects take a look at the tips below. The initial hook ---------------- There are a lot of teams out there saying they practice agile software development, when in reality they’ve just broken up their waterfall roadmap into two-week sprints (often called [agilefall](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/12/29/is-your-project-using-agilefall/)). This can lead to executives in government thinking “well, we tried agile and it didn’t help at all.” What they really tried is the exact same waterfall approach they’ve always been using with a slightly different vernacular surrounding it. This means *really* changing your team into an agile operation can be an uphill battle, because you have to overcome some of these initial biases (just [listen to Tim Gribben, the CFO of the Small Business Administration, talk about how he’s not a fan of agile](https://youtu.be/X26IGyZ-SUY?t=1m33s), but he acknowledges agile development was central to the success of the [DATA Act implementation](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/06/14/prototype-early-prototype-often-lesson-from-the-data-act/)). If you think you’re likely to face resistance from your leadership about trying an agile development approach, you can start out by asking your leadership questions like: - How confident are we that we’ve captured all of the requirements up front? - Do we anticipate any of the requirements may change after our initial planning phase? If so, how will we accommodate that with our team and/or contract? - Are there some areas with lots of variables and moving parts (like legacy technology systems) where we can’t accurately judge the risk up front? - Is it risky to pin all of our hopes and dependencies for this large project on one vendor? - Should we schedule regular demos of the software with the vendor (instead of taking their word for it in status meetings) so that if things aren’t on track, we’ll know sooner? If they start to seem concerned, great! Your stakeholders might see the benefits of agile development even if they’re skeptical of the term agile. If so, try using different terminology, such as “pilot program” or “incremental development” (as encouraged by [OMB](https://management.cio.gov/implementation/#Attachment-A) and the [GAO](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-469)). The [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) is only four basic ideas. It’s more important to bring those ideas into your project than to label your team as agile. Try reading through the slightly longer [list of 12 principles behind the agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) for more terminology that speaks to you and may appeal to your stakeholders. Don’t get too hung up on pitching the agile *process* and focus more on the ideas. And finally, don’t try to pitch them on transitioning to agile for the entire length of the project. Try to break off a small piece of the overall project or an initial prototype and negotiate 6-8 weeks to experiment with agile development. It’s a much smaller commitment, but it gives you some time to make your case with results, instead of hypotheticals. Include your stakeholders from the beginning -------------------------------------------- If you’re able to negotiate a window for experimentation, it’s critical that you include your stakeholders throughout that period. Invite them to your sprint reviews and demo what you and your team have done that sprint. Even if they aren’t enthusiastic about what they see, it gets them used to that feeling of being able to frequently evaluate tangible progress. And if they make suggestions or ask for features, make a show of capturing their request in the backlog to demonstrate the feedback loop between the customer and the product. Find a champion or early adopter -------------------------------- If you can, find a user that your project serves and get their commitment to be on the sprinting team for your experimental period. Have them come to demos, give you feedback, and tell you what else they’d like to see. This will help you prioritize the most important features first. It also means you’ve created an ambassador to your stakeholder community that can help you advocate for agile development later. Prototype with the software you have, not the software you want --------------------------------------------------------------- Just because you’re building a quick, six-week prototype using agile development, it doesn’t mean you need a contractor or software developer on board yet. In fact, the lessons you learn from building something basic can be very valuable when you go to procurement by helping you think through questions you maybe haven’t thought through before. People build prototypes out of everything, from pieces of paper, to office productivity tools (G Suite, Office360, etc.), to content management systems (WordPress, OMB Max, Sharepoint, etc.) to more sophisticated data visualization tools (Tableau, Socrata, etc.). These are just examples and not endorsements of course, but look around at what you have access to at your agency. Just because it doesn’t meet all or even most of your needs, doesn’t mean you can’t use it to build something basic. Prototypes are meant to be temporary. Their real value is helping you think through questions relating to your product with minimal investment. Demonstrate your progress ------------------------- The best thing you can do to convince your stakeholders is to show them the results. Even if they haven’t been regularly attending your sprint reviews, make sure to schedule something definite with them at the end of your experimental period. Show them the progress that you’ve made and make sure to demo what you’ve done instead of only explaining it in a slide deck. Also recap the challenges that you’ve uncovered and ways your requirements may need to change based on your new findings. Transitioning to agile development [doesn’t need to be a big, sweeping, organizational change](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/10/25/three-small-steps-you-can-take-to-reboot-agile-in-your-organization/). You can make it more approachable and less scary by introducing it in small chunks.

Each time a federal developer comes to a different solution, it creates a more fractured experience for public users of government services. Creating a more consistent feel across government websites can help build trust with users, help people clearly identify official websites, and make services easier to use — and saves the government time and money. Approach ### Create better experiences for the American public The U.S. Web Design Standards are a library of design components that can help government developers quickly make trustworthy, accessible, and consistent digital government services. Originally developed as a collaboration between the U.S. Digital Service and 18F, the Standards are now a stable set of code and guidelines designed for the needs of government. Though the Standards are not required to be used for federal government websites, they can help speed up the launch of a new site or bring a modern, consistent look to existing websites and services. The Standards are accessible, responsive, and designed for flexibility and optimized for web performance right out of the box.

Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget are leading the implementation of the DATA Act, but they needed help developing the specifics of the new data standard and its technical implementation. Approach ### Stay flexible to stay ahead of schedule 18F helped build a prototype for the technical implementation of the law to get user feedback before all of the data standards had been finalized. Our iterative approach allowed Treasury to reduce risk, use actual data to make decisions, and speed up implementation of a very complex law. After the initial prototype, Treasury was able to hire a vendor to build the new USAspending.gov, which will give the public powerful tools to examine federal spending. 18F has worked with Treasury and the private vendor to design the site and talk to users to make sure we’re building the best solution possible.

Add the classes `sticky` and `sticky-subnav` to the element that you want to be sticky. 2. Make sure that [sticky.js]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/js/sticky.js) is included in the page. If you are working on the 18F site, it is included on every page by default. 3. Make sure that the element that is receiving `position: sticky` is a child of an element with a greater height. If it is not, it will never appear to be stuck. #### Use of the standards There are a few classes that we are using for the sticky subnavigation on the 18F site: * The `usa-sidenav-list` class, in conjunction with the `usa-current` class. This is mostly taken wholesale from the standards, but does contain slight overrides to better fit with the 18F Brand. * The `usa-accordion` class and accompanying accordion styles. We have added to this set of styles with a `nav-accordion` class that more accurately reflects the look and feel of the site. * The `usa-width-one-third` grid class to define the width of our navigaton field. This isn't necessary, but is a convention throughout the site. #### What to add where To add items to the subnavigation define the subnavigation items directly within page [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), as a set of `nav_items`: ```yml subnav_items: - text: Heading one permalink: /styleguide/sticky-subnavigation/#heading-one - text: Heading two permalink: /styleguide/sticky-subnavigation/#heading-two ``` {% endcapture %} {% include details-code.html title='sticky' content=sticky_codeblock lang=\"html\" description=sticky_description %}"},{"title":"18F UI style guide","url":"/site/styleguide/for-developers/","tags":[],"body":"[18f.gsa.gov](https://18f.gsa.gov), and many 18F websites deployed to [Federalist](https://federalist.fr.cloud.gov) use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build static, maintainable websites.

Below is some guidance on how we use images of various formats throughout the site. Image formats The primary image formats that work well for the web are SVG, JPG, PNG, and GIF. Choosing the correct format can speed up the site and lead to a better user experience. Here are some guidlines that we use when picking images on 18f.gsa.gov: SVG: the fastest loading images. They are generally best suited for iconography, or less complex graphics. They can be added as a Jekyll include, or as an img tag with a source reference. SVGs added as Jekyll includes are rendered as valid html svg elements and can be styled using CSS. JPG: best for photos and more realistic images. PNG: best for text-heavy images, line art, or images with fewer colors. GIF: should only be used for simple animations. JPG, PNG, and GIF can only be added as an img tag with a source reference. Using and optimizing JPG and PNG Before adding images to the site, make sure that they are optimized for the web. Images should be as small as possible without reducing image quality. Crop images to correct dimensions and size. Hero images can be large, but shouldn’t exceed 1040px, the max-width for the site. Export it in the proper format. A good rule of thumb is that JPG is good for photographs and more realistic images, while PNG is best for text-heavy images, line art, or images with fewer colors. Then it is time to compress your image. JPG: you may be able to do some initial compression within your image editor (e.g., Photoshop), establishing a good tradeoff between image quality and image size. For additonal compression, download ImageOptim to optimize the the image further. PNG: drop it into ImageOptim or ImageAlpha and reduce the color palette, establishing a good tradeoff between image quality and size. If the PNG has an alpha channel, turn it into a transparent PNG-8 instead. Follow these steps to add to the repository. Using SVGs SVG is file type as well as a valid HTML element. What this means is that SVGs can be referenced as an img element that represents the SVG graphic as a whole or as an svg element that can be styled using CSS, like a font. The prefered method for adding SVGs on 18f.gsa.gov is as a Jekyll include, as shown below. Follow these steps to use SVGs as regular images. Agile Cyclical arrows representing iterative design Code {% include svg/icons/agile-icon.svg %} Documentation To use an SVG as an include: Add the SVG to the /_includes/svg/ directory. In an include tag, reference the file path of the SVG relative to the _includes directory. Accessibility To follow accessibility guidelines, make sure that the SVG image file contains all the necessary markup to allow screenreader users to browse your site without difficulty. From the WCAG guidlines on creating accessibile SVGs: title: Provides a human-readable title for the element that contains it. The title element may be rendered by a graphical user agent as a tooltip. It may be rendered as speech by a speech synthesizer. desc: Provides a longer more complete description of an element that contains it. Authors should provide descriptions for complex or other content that has functional meaning. If the SVG is a presentation only image, meaning that it is assistive, but not necessary to provide context within the site, add the following attributes to the svg tag itself: role=\"img\" aria-hidden=\"true\" SVG include catalog This is a list of all of the SVGs that are available as includes (in the _includes directory).

For some icons this is defined as by the width and height attributes on the SVG. For the smallest icons, it is set by the .icon class on the SVG itself. Adding images To add images to the site: Add the image to the assets directory. - Blog images go in the /assets/blog/ directory. The subdirectories are organized by topic, so place the image in the directory that pertains to blog post’s primary topic. For detailed information on adding images to the blog, see Blog. - All other images can go in the /assets/img/ directory. Reference the file path in an image tag, making sure to prefix the path with {{ site.baseurl }} and adding alt text for accessibility purposes. Example of successful image reference with alt text Example of successful image reference with empty alt text Example of failed image with alt text Example of failed image without alt text Code #### Example of successful image reference with alt text #### Example of successful image reference with empty alt text #### Example of failed image with alt text #### Example of failed image without alt text Documentation The primary way to use both site and blog-specific images is to directly call the image path in an img tag. The /site insures that the path is relative to the root of the directory. Ensure that each image has alt text for improved site accessibility. If the image is presentational only, empty alt text can be added, like so: alt=\"\". Image lists This pattern associates text with an icon to break up text blocks improve user understanding.

Attribute | Type | What it does --- | --- | --- `title` | String | Title for the page visible in blue banner at the top of the page `permalink` | String |Path that the page renders relative to the site's `baseurl` `layout` | String | Should be set to `primary` `lead` | String | _(optional)_ Large white text that renders on the top blue banner `banner_cta` | Boolean | _(optional)_ Set to `false` by default. Generates a light blue call to action banner when set to `true`. `subnav_items` | Object | _(optional)_ Navigation items object that contains a list of subnavigation items that contain a `permalink` and `text`. Renders a [sticky subnav]({{ site.baseurl }}/styleguide/components/#sticky-subnavigation) on the left side of the page. `subnav_title` | String| _(optional)_ Set if you want the subnav title or breadcumb text to differ from the page `title`. `hero` | Boolean | _(optional)_ Enables a hero image in the banner. Defaults to `true`, so set to `false` to hide the image `image` | String | _(optional)_ Path to hero image. This image will also display on blog post preview cards `image_alt` | String | _(optional)_ Accessibility text for the image `image_figcaption` | String | _(optional)_ A caption that will be displayed on top of the image `breadcrumb` | Boolean | _(optional)_ Set to `false` by default.

Example of project page template. Found at FEC project page. #### Add a project page 1. Create a new file within the `_projects` directory, named with the following format: `[agency acronym]-[project-name].md`. 2. Copy the [project page template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/master/examples/project-template.md) to that file. 3. Replace all relavent front matter fields. To see if a field is required, see the [project page schema](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/blob/master/tests/schema/_projects.yml). 4. If you are adding an image, make sure to [check out the wiki](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/wiki/Finding-the-right-image-for-a-project-page). If you are not adding an image, make sure to specify an `image_icon` property in the front matter, and reference an SVG available in the [SVG catalog]({{ site.basurl }}/images/svg-include-catalog) like so: ```yml image_icon: gavel.svg ``` 5. Populate the sidebar for at a glance information. To do this, update the front matter related to the sidebar. If you don't want something to show up in the sidebar, remove it from the front matter. --- ### Blog post template Located at [`_layouts/post.html`](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/tree/master/_layouts/post.html), this is the template for creating new blog posts. Example of a blog post template. Found at NASA's journey with the U.S. Web Design Standards. There is extensive documentation for how to [publish a blog post](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/wiki/Publishing-a-blog-post) on the wiki and an [example blog post](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/blob/master/examples/blog-post.md) to assist with adding metadata and frequently used blog components. A deeper dive into those components is available at [Blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/syleguide/blog/). --- ### Grid The layout and grid structure inherits from the U.S. Web Design Standards and makes some slight adjustments. Layout changes are not overrides of the standards, but a handful of CSS classes have been added to compliment the Standards. Class name | What it does --- | --- [`usa-width-tablet`](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/blob/master/_sass/_core/grid.scss) | A class that allows certain content, namely the [project cards]({{ site.baseurl }}/styleguide/project-cards/), and the [blog previews]({{ site.baseurl }}/styleguide/blog-components/#post-previews) to respond at a different breakpoint, [`$tablet-screen`](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/blob/master/_sass/_core/variables.scss) (768px). [`usa-flex`](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/blob/master/_sass/_components/layout.scss) | Wrapper class that sets `display: flex`, and can be used to create more flexible layouts. Classes used with `usa-flex` | `usa-flex-baseline`, `usa-flex-end`, `usa-flex-pull-right`, `usa-flex-always`, `usa-flex-wrap`, `usa-flex-vertically-top`, `usa-flex-pull-right`, and `usa-flex-vertically-bottom`. [`usa-grid-reversed`](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/blob/master/_sass/_core/grid.scss) | This class can be used to alternate the order that content appears in mobile vs desktop screen widths. `content-wide` | In the Standards, the primary way to improve readability is via the `usa-content` class, which [limits content to 75 characters](https://standards.usa.gov/components/typography/#typesetting). Instead of relying on this mechanism, the site wraps site content with the `content-focus` class, [limiting the entire grid to roughly 100 characters](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/blob/master/_sass/_components/layout.scss). `content-focus` | When the the grid needs to be wider, `content-wide` is used and the content width is controlled by using partial grid layouts. --- ### Sidebar This attribute is found in the [contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) and [project pages]({{ site.baseurl }}/what-we-deliver/federalist/) on the 18F site.
